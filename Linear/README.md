# Code for "Analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Applied to Linear Systems" Chapter


* Execute [experiments.sh](./exerperiments.sh) to run the experiments of the chapter. 
* Note: The required packages need to be installed in order to run the experiments. Furthermore, the data creation will need sufficient free disk space. 
* Data will be stored in a folder ./data/run_name for every run
* Running loggs will be stored in ./loggs
  1. the directory contains a progress_information.txt file that indicated the experiments progress
  2. for every run a run_name.txt file contains the running output information created during that run
* Plotts will automatlically be created for every run and stored in the same folder
